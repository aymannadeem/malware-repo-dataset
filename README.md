# malware-repo-dataset

This repository hosts a ground-truth dataset curated in service of a dissertation submitted for an MSc in Computer Science at Oxford University, _Malware Detection on Developer Platforms using Models trained on Exogenous Signals_. The dataset was used to train a machine learning pipeline used to predict which repositories contain malware using user activity data patterns. 

This dataset extends the existing [SourceFinder]([url](http://www.hackerchatter.org/)) dataset in two ways: 

1. Additional features representing user activity data are added via the GitHub REST API.
2. Since the SourceFinder dataset only contains repositories with malware, this dataset adds benign repositories. Ground-truth labels indicating benign and malware repositories are given by the `has_malware` column, in which a truthy value of "1" indicates the repository hosts malware. Half of the repositories contain malware, ensuring a balanced distribution.
